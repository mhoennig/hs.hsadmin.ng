## ADR-Concept

This project uses ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), see also https://adr.github.io/.

There is a template available under [0000-00-00.adr-tempate.md](./0000-00-00.adr-tempate.md).

It's suggested to write an ADR if any of these is true:

- an architectural decision is hard to change,
- there is a dispute about an architectural decision,
- some unusual architectural decision was made (e.g. unusual library),
- some deeper investigation was necessary before the decision.

ADRs should not be written for minor decisions with limited impact.
